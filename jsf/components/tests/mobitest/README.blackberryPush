In order for cloud notification to even attempt to work for blackberry devices, a number 
of conditions must be met 

- icepush-ee.jar must be present in the WEB-INF/lib directory (it's not, by default)
- The server must be run with the following run time property defined: 
  -Dorg.icemobile.blackberry.applicationCredentials=1868-72162e8r2m8tr292r9D3o2i7890921k9s66:2sAp3MMG

  It's easiest to do this in Tomcat through JAVA_OPTS in catalina.sh or catalina.bat. The 
exact credentials change with Blackberry push infrastructure and this exact string will change 
periodically. ICESoft has a trial push service identified by this string, but other clients will 
have their own permanent identification string. 

- If the icepush-ee jar is present, and the server is started with the correct property, the BPNSNotificationProvider 
should autoregister itself with the main cloud push server. You should see a logging message of the form: 

9-Feb-2012 9:11:20 AM com.icesoft.icepush.BPNSNotificationProvider$AutoRegister contextInitialized
INFO: Registering BPNS notification provider, appId: 1868-72162e8r2m8tr292r9D3o2i7890921k9s66


- The RIM library code is rather unfriendly and requires a number of additional jars to be present to 
attempt to send a message via our trial application through the RIM PUSH service. The following jars are required: 

1) rim-commons-pushsdk-1.0.1.11.jar (or any similar version) 
2) rim-pap-1.0.1.11.jar   (or any similar version)   (Both these files are in icepush-ee/lib 
3) commons-codec-1.3.jar  (or similar) 
4) log4j.jar              (any recent version) 

- Further, a PushSDK.properties PAP configuration file needs to exist in the 'webapplication/WEB-INF/classes/' 
directory. This file isn't checked in as it contains application specific PIN information that we 
don't want to share with others.


- For the actual attempt to send a push request, again, we're using the RIM infrastructure (BIS-push) 
to send the messages from the server to the phones. When we register for this service, we must provide an 
IP address for the server sending the requests, which is currently the IP assigned to www.icemobile.org. That means 
attempts to send messages from other servers will result in the following: 

SEVERE: Exception sending BPNS push: net.rim.pushsdk.commons.UnauthorizedException: Unauthorized to 
communicate with the PPG at URL: https://pushapi.eval.blackberry.com/mss/PD_pushRequest with 
username: 1868-72162e8r2m8tr292r9D3o2i7890921k9s66 and password: 2sAp3MMG


However, if this message is logged, it indicates the application is going as far as it can without 
using a client PAP service or commercial RIM push licence, so that's good. If there are other ClassNotFound 
exceptions or other problems those need to be corrected.

        <p>The camera component allows JSF applications to access a mobile devices’
            camera. The component renders a simple button that, when pressed, launches
            the native camera application on the device. Once a picture has been taken
            and accepted, the user is returned to the web application. Image data
            captured by the device is inserted in the calling form and data is
            submitted to the server via a standard JSF form post.</p>

        <p>
            Value binding is achieved via a Map object so that other important
            camera image data can be stored along with the image file data. A
            typical camera component setup looks as follows:
        </p>

<pre>
&lt;mobi:camera
    value="#{'#'}{myBean.map}"/&gt;
</pre>

        <p>
            When the containing form is submitted to the server the setter
            setMap() is called on the bean, making the camera image 
            available to the application.
        </p>

        <p>Device camera is only accessible if the application is running
            in an ICEmobile device container, otherwise
            the component will display a file upload input component. </p>

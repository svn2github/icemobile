        <p>The outputList component can be used to generate navigation

            most widely used constructs for mobile applications. </p>

            The component tag lives in the mobic name space as is it is currently
            defined as a Facelets composite component. Future release will
            introduced this component as a concrete JSF component and the current
            form can be thought of as a proof of concept.

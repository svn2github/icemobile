        <p>The fieldsetGroup component is a common mobile user interface
            construct for displaying application input such as a settings panel
            or input form. The fieldsetComponent component can contain one or
            more child fieldsetRow components which logically divides the fieldset
            into sub sections. The inset also has an optional inset attribute
            which can be useful when trying to distinguish multiple fieldsetGroups
            on one page. </p>

    &lt;mobic:fieldsetGroup
            inset="true" &gt;
        &lt;mobic:fieldsetRow&gt;

            &lt;mobi:inputText /&gt;

    &lt;/mobic:fieldsetGroup&gt;

        <p>
            The component lives in the mobic name space
            as is it is currently defined as a Facelets composite component.
            Future release will introduced this component as a concrete JSF
            component. and the current form can be thought of as a proof of concept.
            Currently the child components must be list elements.

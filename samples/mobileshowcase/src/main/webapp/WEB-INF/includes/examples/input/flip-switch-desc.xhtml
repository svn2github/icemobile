        <p>The flipSwitch component displays a command button that toggles
            between an On and Off state. This UI element is common on the iOS
            platform for toggling a setting on or off. This component generates
            server side action event when pressed. </p>

            The component tag lives in the mobic name space as is it is currently
            defined as a Facelets composite component. Future release will
            introduced this component as a concrete JSF component and the current
            form can be thought of as a proof of concept.

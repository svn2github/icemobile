        <p>The video component is a rendering aid for developers who need to
            load images from a data source other then the file system like a
            database. The component can take byte[], Resource or a fixed URL
            to a valid video file. Playback format support maybe limited by
            the capabilities of the devices operating systems. </p>

            The video component uses JSF 2 resource handling and as a result it
            is necessary to set scope on the video resource. Resource scope is
            the same as Bean scope and defines how long the video resource will
            remain in scope.
        </p>

        <p>
            The video component is support in both the ICEfaces container and a
            standalone mobile browser.

        <p>Device notification is a server to client mechanism used to alert a
            device-resident application that some external state change has
            occurred when the application is not actively being used. 
            This is achieve using a device-specific notification mechanism like
	    an icon displayed in a notification status bar.</p>

        <p>Developers familiar with ICEfaces Ajax Push will find notification initiation
            quite simple. Notification can be sent to a group of devices with the
            following line of code:</p>

<pre>
PushRenderer.render(
    group, message);
</pre>

        <p>
            ICEfaces device notification supports Android C2DM, Apple APNS, Blackberry Push Service, and
            general email notification.

        <p>Device notification is a server to client mechanism used to alert a
            device-resident application that some external state change has
            occurred. In the case of a web application that is ICEpush-enabled,
            device notification will typically be used when the application is
            not active (and ICEpush is idle)</p>

        <p>
            Usert Notification is a native device capability to indicate to the
            user that something has happened in an application. User notification
            can occur when the application is idle or actively in use. Typically,
            device UIs include a notification or status bar where notification
            icons can be placed.
        </p>

        <p>Developers familiar with ICEpush will fine notification initiation
            quite simple. Notification can be sent to a group of devices with the
            following line of code:</p>

<pre>
PushRenderer.render(group, message);
</pre>

        <p>
            ICEfaces device notification supports Android C2DM, Apple APNS and
            general email notification.

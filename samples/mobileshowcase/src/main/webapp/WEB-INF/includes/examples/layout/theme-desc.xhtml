        <p>The mobi and mobic components have been skinned to match popular
            mobile platforms but can also be easily extend to match custom
            corporate themes. The mobile platforms Android, iOS and Blackberry
            have been targeted for initial support. </p>

            A new component deviceOutputStyle has been created to automatically

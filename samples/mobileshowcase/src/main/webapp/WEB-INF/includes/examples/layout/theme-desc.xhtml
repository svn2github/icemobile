        <p>Mobi components have been skinned to match the
            mobile platforms, but can also be easily extended to match custom
            corporate themes. The mobile platforms Android, iOS and Blackberry
            have been targeted for initial support. jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller
            is also supported and existing mobile ThemeRoller skins can be
            imported</p>

        <p>To have a device theme automatically applied to your ICEmobile 
        page, simply include the following component in the head of
        your page:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;mobi:deviceResources /&gt;
</pre>

        <p>
            The deviceResource component will automatically
            detect the current platform and load the corresponding CSS.
            Specific themes can also be used by using the 'theme' attribute and
            specifying one of the built-in themes, such as iPhone (iphone), iPad (ipad),
            Android Holo light and dark (android_light &amp; android_dark), 
            BlackBerry (bberry), BlackBerry 10 (bb10), and jQuery mobile (jqm).

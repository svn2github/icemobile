/**
 * Controller for registration of ICEmobile-SX in the session.
 * Add this controller to your Spring MVC application to support
 * ICEmobile-SX.
 *
 * ICEmobile-SX makes use of an "auxiliary upload" technique where
 * an HTTP POST containing an uploaded photo or String value from
 * a scanned barcode occurs outside the brower and separate from 
 * the other Ajax interaction by the user.  This requires the upload
 * to be stored for that user across multiple requests.  The simplest
 * mechanism for this is to use a Servlet session.  Additionally, it
 * is necessary to record whether the user has ICEmobile-SX installed,
 * and this is recorded in the session.
 *
 * A future version of ICEmobile will provide for request parameters,
 * short-lived upload identifier keys, and a registration cookie, 
 * thereby avoiding the session requirement.  Additionally, the
 * /icemobile path will be configurable.
 *

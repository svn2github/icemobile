        <p>Cloud Push is a server to client mechanism used to alert the user 
	   that some external state change has
            occurred in an application that is not actively being used. 
            This is achieve using a device-specific notification mechanism like
	    displaying an icon in a notification status bar.</p>

        <p>Developers familiar with ICEfaces Ajax Push will find cloud push initiation
            quite simple. Notification can be sent to a group of devices with the
            following line of code:</p>
        </mobi:fieldsetRow>
        <mobi:fieldsetRow>
<pre>
PushRenderer.render(
    group, message);
</pre>
        </mobi:fieldsetRow>
        <mobi:fieldsetRow>
        <p>
            ICEfaces device notification supports Android GCM, Apple APNS, Blackberry Push Service, and
            general email notification.

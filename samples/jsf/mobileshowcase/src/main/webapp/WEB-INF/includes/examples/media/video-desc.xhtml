        <p>The videoPlayer component can play video from a variety of sources.
        A database, byte array in memory, JSF Resource, or any server-side video
        file can be used. Playback support may be limited by
        the device capabilities. </p>

        <p>
            The videoPlayer component uses JSF 2 resource handling, making it
            necessary to set scope on the video resource. Resource scope is
            similar to bean scope and defines how long the video resource will
            remain in scope.
        </p>

        <p>
            The videoPlayer component is supported in both the ICEmobile container and a
            stand-alone mobile browser.

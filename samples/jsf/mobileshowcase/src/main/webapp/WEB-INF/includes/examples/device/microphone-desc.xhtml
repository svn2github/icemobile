        <p>The microphone component allows JSF applications to access a mobile
            device audio recorder. The component renders a simple button that, when
            pressed, activates a native interface that captures audio using the device microphone.
            Audio data captured by the device is inserted into the calling form
            and data is submitted to the server via a standard JSF form post.</p>
            
         <p>
            The button label can be changed after audio has been recorded to 
            notify the user. The 'buttonLabel' attribute is first displayed, and after
            the audio has been captured, the 'captureMessageLabel' attribute value is
            then shown as the button label. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Value binding is achieved via a Map object so that other important
            sound data can be stored along with the sound file data. A typical
            microphone component setup looks as follows:
        </p>
        </mobi:fieldsetRow>
        <mobi:fieldsetRow>

<pre>
&lt;mobi:microphone duration="10" 
  buttonLabel="Record Audio"
  captureMessageLabel="Audio recorded"
  value="&#x2317;{bean.audioFileMap}"/&gt;
</pre>
        </mobi:fieldsetRow>
        <mobi:fieldsetRow>
    
    <p>Device audio recording access is only available if the application is running
            in an ICEmobile device container or if ICEmobile SX has been registered, 
            otherwise the component will display a file upload input component. </p>

        <p>The DataView component renders a tabular output region defined by the DataViewColumns child component and a
            detail region defined by the DataViewDetails child component. The rows of the table region may be tapped on
            touch devices to reveal the details region, rendered with the specifics of the given row object. That region
            may contain arbitrary JSF components allowing display and editing of information not visible in the tabular
            display of this row object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Row styling can be controlled with the rowStyle and rowStyleClass attributes. In the example,
            all cars below $30,000 are styled in green, all cars above this amount are styled in red.
